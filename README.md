# Modules
These are the modules included in this package.

## Interhaptics
Parameter support for Interhaptics-based devices such as Razer headsets with Razer Sensa haptic feedback.
This can potentially be a replacement for people who use (mainly) headsets with Razer's haptic feedback to posess similar functionality of something similar to OSCGoesBRR or a Gigglepuck.
This includes the following devices:
Razer Kraken V4 Pro
Razer Freyja
Razer Wolverine V3 Pro
