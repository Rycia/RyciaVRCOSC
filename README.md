# Modules
These are the modules included in this package.

## Interhaptics
Parameter support for Interhaptics-based devices such as Razer headsets with Razer Sensa haptic feedback.  

This requires Razer Synapse to be installed.  
In order to use this module, you must allow the application in your Razer Chroma Studio under Chroma Apps, and make sure Chroma Apps are enabled altogether.
Please read this entire section to ensure your setup is correct.  

This can potentially be a replacement for people who use headsets and other devices with Razer's haptic feedback to posess similar functionality of something similar to OSCGoesBRR or a Gigglepuck.  
This includes the following devices:
- Razer Kraken V4 Pro
- Razer Nari Ultimate
- Razer Freyja
- Razer Wolverine V3 Pro  

These are just a few devices, please report to add to the list here if there's a missing device.
